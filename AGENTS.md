# Slice Soft Demo Codex Instructions

## Project Identity

- Project: `slice_soft_demo`
- Repository: `polarbao/slice_soft_demo`
- Current branch/ref: `main` as of 2026-07-10; verify with `git branch --show-current` before each task
- Main implementation paths: `src/slicer_core`, `apps/slicer_cli`, `apps/slicer_debug_ui`
- Formal docs: `docs/slice`
- Codex task docs: `docs/codex_task`
- Archived historical docs: `docs/archive/2026-06-30_slicer_legacy`
- Tech stack: C++20, Qt 5.15 Widgets, CMake, Windows x64/MSVC, optional OpenVDB via vcpkg
- Default test command: `ctest --test-dir build -C Debug --output-on-failure`

## Current Phase

- `12A` material fill, support, and varnish semantics have completed the current P0/P1 scope.
- `12B-R0/R1/R2` performance evaluation and OpenVDB SDF utility positioning are complete.
- `12C-R0` Qt workbench build compatibility and baseline admission is complete.
- `12C-R1` Profile and Settings closure is complete.
- `12C-R0/R1/R2` Qt workbench is complete; final fresh build, UI Smoke, and CTest passed.
- The latest completed task is `12D-06 Repair Disabled TIFF invariance verification`.
- Current working phase is `12D-R3 PREPARED / NOT STARTED`: explicit 1px repair, background protection, UI, and real-model acceptance.
- `12E-R0` startup preparation is complete. `12E-01 Config/DTO contract` is `PREPARED / READY FOR USER ADMISSION`, but no 12E code task is active.
- `12D-R0` documentation admission is complete and the 12C gate is satisfied.
- No 12D-R3 or 12E code task is active. `12D-07 Repair Enabled` and `12E-01 Config/DTO contract` each require an explicit user instruction; do not start either track automatically.
- The formal product direction is tracked in `docs/slice`; operational Codex tasks are tracked in `docs/codex_task/current`.

## Always-On Rules

1. Answer in Chinese unless the user explicitly asks for English.
2. Execute only the task explicitly requested by the user; do not start the next task without explicit instruction.
3. Before code, build, dependency, or architecture changes, read the relevant source and project docs first.
4. Do not invent command results, tests, builds, hardware validation, repository state, or implementation status.
5. Before each task, run `git status --short` and report unrelated dirty state instead of overwriting it.
6. Do not revert or delete user changes unless the user explicitly requests that operation.
7. For destructive operations, dependency upgrades, architecture migration, production-path changes, hardware/device control, or git history rewrite, give a plan and wait for confirmation.
8. After a minimal task, run task-specific validation. Before committing, run `git status --short` and `git diff --check`.
9. Commit only when the user asks or when the active task explicitly requires it; do not push unless explicitly instructed.

## Evidence Classification

- A: current code/config/tests/build scripts; safe implementation basis.
- B: formal `docs/slice` PRD/DEV/ADR/decision docs; target direction, not proof of implementation.
- C: archived demo docs, historical reports, chat logs, and completed Codex prompts/tasks; background only.
- D: deprecated or conflicting material; do not use as implementation basis.

When answering implementation-state questions, split the answer into `Current State`, `Target State`, `Historical State`, and `Pending Confirmation` when relevant.

## Skill Routing

- Slice feature planning and staged execution: `$slice-dev-workflow`
- Slice architecture boundaries and ADR/DOC_DECISION work: `$slice-architecture-guardrails`
- Slice build, dependency, CMake, packaging, and CI issues: `$slice-build`
- Slice code review and pre-merge checks: `$slice-code-review`
- Slice document-state conflict resolution: `$slice-doc-state-resolver`
- Slice context handoff: `$slice-context-handoff`
- Slice chat save/archive: `$slice-chat-save`
- Generic C++20/Qt/CMake guidance: `$cpp-coding-standards`
- Generic plan writing or project planning: `$writing-plans` / `$project-planner`

Project-level slice skills and `.agents/docs` facts override generic templates when they conflict.

## Production Safety Rules

1. Do not enable OpenVDB by default.
2. Do not make OpenVDB a mandatory dependency for all builds.
3. Do not replace the legacy `slicer_cli` production path.
4. Do not write production RGBWSV TIFF from the experimental OpenVDB path unless a later task explicitly allows it.
5. Do not modify the `p0.rgbwsv.2` production package protocol.
6. Do not modify RGBWSV channel order.
7. Do not modify uint8 bit depth.
8. Do not modify `black_is_print` polarity.
9. Do not treat `warn_and_attempt` output as production-safe.
10. Confirmed self-intersection must fail fast.
11. Non-manifold, duplicate/opposite duplicate, and local winding issues must block strict production admission.

## Expected Workflow Per Task

For every task:

```powershell
git status --short
```

For documentation/config-only tasks, validate with targeted text/schema checks and `git diff --check`.
For C++/Qt/CMake changes, use the task-specific commands from `.agents/docs/build-and-test.md`.
