# Slice Soft Demo Project Profile

- Project: `slice_soft_demo`
- Repository: `polarbao/slice_soft_demo`
- Domain: Industrial UV / inkjet 3D printing slicing Host Software prototype
- Current phase: Stage 12E R4 restricted production-candidate closure; R4-07-R2 is complete and production admission remains not evaluated
- Latest completed milestone: Stage 12E-08C-R4-07-R2 Restricted Candidate Budget Freeze
- Latest completed task: `12E-08C-R4-07-R2 reference-machine candidate budget freeze`
- Current task: `Quick-CI-R1 baseline resolution preparation`; `12E-09A-02` remains an independent executable diagnostic UI task; 12E-08D remains NOT READY / NO-GO
- Prepared stage: R4-06 two-family intake is 2/2, R4-07-R1 four-case Release/closure/legacy/RIP evidence is PASS, and R4-07-R2 candidate budget `2026-07-23.r1` is frozen PASS. Quick CI baseline resolution, R4-08-R2, and explicit authorization are still required for 08D. 12E-09A-02..06 remain prepared; 12E-09B remains blocked by 08D.
- Validated R4 model inputs: 22 OBJ/3MF assets under `model` were audited. All 5 OBJ files under `model/obj/xiao_ma_wu_yu_new` plus `model/obj/yecan/3.obj` and `model/obj/yecan/4.obj` are strict PASS; xiao_ma Damuzhi and yecan/3 are the two tracked restricted-candidate baseline families. The aishen/meigui/titian families remain a 0/3 complex-relief coverage gap because all 9 candidates have confirmed self-intersection. The `model` directory has no strict-PASS 3MF; use `samples/models/3mf/texture2d_checker_cube.3mf` only as the positive Texture2D control lane.
- Main language: C++20
- UI: Qt 5.15 Widgets, UI layer only
- Build: CMake target-based, Windows x64 / MSVC
- Tools: `slicer_cli`, `rip_reader_test`, `slicer_debug_ui`
- Formal docs: `docs/slice`
- Codex tasks: `docs/codex_task`
- Historical docs: `docs/archive/2026-06-30_slicer_legacy`
- Scripts: `scripts/run_regression.ps1`, `scripts/run_ci_quick.ps1`, `scripts/run_schema_tests.ps1`, `scripts/run_golden_tests.ps1`, `scripts/run_09p_cli_experimental_tests.ps1`, `scripts/run_09p_experimental_pipeline_tests.ps1`, `scripts/run_openvdb_smoke.ps1`

## Core capabilities

```text
OBJ / MTL / Texture input
STL ASCII / Binary input
3MF stored / deflate input
3MF BaseMaterial / ColorGroup / Texture2DGroup
3MF bad package validation
MaterialRoleMapping
MaterialPolicy
MaterialProcessProfile
Support / SupportType / island diagnostics
Geometry diagnostics / ProductionAdmissionPolicy
Relief heightfield
RGBWSV TIFF writer
RIP reader strict validation
Preview report / preview PNG
Preview/material process reports
Qt Debug UI
UI self-test / overlay-load-real smoke test
OpenVDB optional experimental surface-shell texture path
Target-only selectable legacy/global_surface_shell pipeline contract; global production path not implemented
quick/full/heavy regression
```

## Critical constraints

```text
Do not change p0.rgbwsv.2 without explicit decision.
Do not introduce Qt into slicer_core.
Do not enable OpenVDB by default.
Do not make OpenVDB mandatory for all builds.
Do not replace the legacy slicer_cli production path.
Do not write production RGBWSV TIFF from the experimental OpenVDB path unless explicitly approved.
Do not treat warn_and_attempt output as production-safe.
Confirmed self-intersection must fail fast.
Non-manifold, duplicate/opposite duplicate, and local winding issues must block strict production admission.
Keep slicer_cli / rip_reader_test / slicer_debug_ui buildable.
Run targeted validation after each meaningful code or doc-governance step.
```

## Current code concentration risk

```text
model.cpp: scene, OBJ/MTL, 3MF, texture/material resource parsing mixed together.
slicer.cpp: pipeline, raster, relief, support, materials, output, reports, preview mixed together.
config.cpp: schema/default/migration/validation concerns mixed together.
```
